- Used Verilog to create a fully-functioning 32 bit CPU and Datapath that decodes ARM Assembly instructions and executes them completely on a DE1-SOC FPGA.
- Executed extensive coding in System verilog synthesized with Quartus and created extensive test benches to verify the functioning of each and every feature in the project using Modelsim
